## Day 3 : January 9, 2025

**Today's Progress :**  
i'm working on freecodecamp challenge on React Redux courses. this challenge build up my confidence on react redux. if i can take a conclusion, react is just a view library - a library that shows a view in an eficient way. as we know, when we want to show something, there must we something that we should shown - that is the data (state). to manage this state, we use redux. simply put, redux system consist of store, action (action to trigger change in the store), and reducer(s) to change state in the store.

## Day 16 : January 25, 2025

**Today's Progress :**  
trying to use react component for my projects at freecodecamp - creating a markdown reviewer.

**Work(s) :**

## Day 17 : January 26, 2025

**Today's Progress :**  
i'm succesfully use react component for my project - creating a markdown reviewer. but, it still doesn't render any markdown yet, instead it is rendering plain text.

**Work(s) :**

## Day 18 : January 27, 2025

**Today's Progress :**  
in order to render markdown, we can use `marked.js`, a js library for rendering markdown string. i've read the documentation, but it's still not working.

**Work(s) :**

## Day 19 : January 28, 2025

**Today's Progress :**  
i've followed the documentation. it was said that we can use `marked.parse()` method, but it is not working. there are other alternative i found from gemini AI and stack overflow, but none of them were worked.

**Work(s) :**

## Day 20 : January 29, 2025

**Today's Progress :**  
it'is working now. the problem is that i use react, and when i use react & marked.js, the `marked.parsed()` result is considered as promises object coming from an asyncrhonous process instead of a string. that's why we need to treat it as an asynchronous process. i'm success :)

**Work(s) :**

## Day 21 : January 30, 2025

**Today's Progress :**  
hey! it's not done yet :( altough i can get the result, i stil can't take it off from the asynchronous function and bring it to another function in order to ready to use. it's frustrating!
