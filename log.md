## Day 3 : January 9, 2025

**Today's Progress :**  
i'm working on freecodecamp challenge on React Redux courses. this challenge build up my confidence on react redux. if i can take a conclusion, react is just a view library - a library that shows a view in an eficient way. as we know, when we want to show something, there must we something that we should shown - that is the data (state). to manage this state, we use redux. simply put, redux system consist of store, action (action to trigger change in the store), and reducer(s) to change state in the store.

**Work(s) :**
- [manage state locally first - freeCodeCamp](/resources/manage-state-locally-first.js)
- [extract state logic to redux - freeCodeCamp](/resources/extract-state-logic-to-redux.js)
