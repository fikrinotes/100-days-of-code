## Day 1: Sept 11th, 2024

**Today's Progress :**  Learn about state and stateful component in react. it's hard, tho. i need more time to study.

**Work(s) :**

## Day 2: Sept 12th, 2024

**Today's Progress :**  today is the second day of #100DaysOfCode . i learn about the `setState()` method to create/update the value of state in react.

**Work(s) :**

## Day 3: Sept 14th, 2024

**Today's Progress :**  learn how to update state properties in react. it is not as easy as i guess. for this reason, i also learn that we need to bind class component to class method in order to acces and modify it in the class method.

**Work(s) :**

## Day 4: Sept 15th, 2024

**Today's Progress :**  progressively continue the learning path from the previous day, i learn that we can also use an updater function to update state properties in react. for me, it's a complex concept

## Day 5: Sept 16th, 2024

**Today's Progress :**  sadly, i only done 2 task at freecodecamp this day. but, i learn a lot. i learn how to keep track of input value as a state in react and how to handle DOM events using functions. before this day, i don't really understand the mechanism of calling a function for handling events in HTML, such as using `onClick` or `onChange` property.

## Day 6: Sept 17th, 2024

**Today's Progress :** same thing as before... just completed 2 more challenges at freecodecamp front end developer path. it's hard to learn coding at night! for the next time, maybe i should try to work on evening.

## Day 7: Sept 19th, 2024

**Today's Progress :** learn how to pass state and methods of parent component to child component in react. isn't hard tho. The theory is that, if we want t pass state and methods of parent component to it's child, just pass it as props of the child.

## Day 9: Sept 23th, 2024

**Today's Progress :** this day i've got a real hands-on web development process using react. first of all, i tried to install react js with next js framework. but it's not easy because it goes to fail for the first try. after aproximately 1 hour, i'm successfully installed react and next js.

**Work(s) :**

## Day 10: Sept 25th, 2024

## Day 11: Sept 26th, 2024

**Today's Progress :** same thing as before, i want to get hands-on experience on how to build a fully react app by using Next JS. it is not obvious before about how to run the react server. i've read all react documentation and i found nothing. is there something i left? i don't know

**Work(s) :**

## Day 12: Sept 28th, 2024

**Today's Progress :** there's nothing special, just regular practice on freecodecamp challenge. i learn advance react syntax and method. how to do conditional display, sending data, etc

**Work(s) :**

## Day 12: Sept 29th, 2024

**Today's Progress :** same things as before, there's nothing special. so far, i'm a little bit confusing with freeCodeCamp Course on react. i think it's not either teaching the concept of react nor the implementation of react by building a project. there's so much missing step on how to build react project in this course. i mean, even if i completed this single course only, i think i still cannot build any website using react framework. that's because, when we're working on the challenges, there's some code that we don't know where is these code come from, it's already there. we are just fill in the blank space. i think it's not the correct way to learn how to code. freecodecamp is also not teaching the file structure of react project, so if we want to build a new react app on our own, we don't know where to start. but, above all that, i will complete this course. even if i the course in react official website itself is more helpful for learning react than the freecodecamp course.
